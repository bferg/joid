JOID lets you create both OpenID 2.0 relying parties and identity providers.

See the [JavaOne 2007](http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/j1sessn.jsp?sessn=TS-6536&yr=2007&track=8) presentation on OpenID and JOID.

The [Introduction page](http://code.google.com/p/joid/wiki/Introduction) shows you how to use it.
