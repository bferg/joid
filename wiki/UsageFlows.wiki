#summary The JOID usage flows.
#labels Featured

The incoming OpenID request is handled by an _OpenID_ object, which has an associated _Store _and a _Crypto_ engine. Using these and a !RequestFactory, a proper _Request_ is instantiated. 

This request then processes using the store and crypto into a _Response), which is funneled back to the requestor.

Note that the flow can be reversed, with a _Response_ as input. This makes it possible to create relying parties as well as identity providers!
